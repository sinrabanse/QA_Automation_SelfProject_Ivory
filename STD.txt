2)Load/Stress Testing
Load and stress testing cannot be conducted due to the absence of a dedicated test environment.
3)Survival/Recovery Testing
Testing for system recovery and failure handling is not feasible due to the lack of an appropriate test setup.
4)Mobile Compatibility Testing
The mobile UI differs significantly from the desktop version, requiring a complete rewrite of tests
